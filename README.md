# Video App Using Vue.js

This is a video application similar to Netflix where each individual audio / video “page” (or view) should includes reviews, ratings, movie details
(director, year, genre, synopsis etc) including controls to add a new rating or review. The
interactive elements are handled by Vue.js - when a user adds a comment or a
review/rating, the view is updated with Vue.js methods / data. The database is updated with an
AJAX call using the fetch API.
